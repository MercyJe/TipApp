## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Had to build a new app, the old app kept crashing for unknown reasons
The error given was array out of bounds which after debugging was not so.

Because I used a friends Mac getting permission to git was not possible, as well as adding additional features within the 
time constraint
